TASK:
Add a PREMIUM 3D SCROLL EXPERIENCE inspired by rangerover3d.vercel.app
to the "Washington Advert" website.

IMPORTANT:
• This is a digital marketing agency website
• DO NOT add heavy 3D models
• Recreate ONLY the motion, depth, and camera feel
• Brand name must remain "Washington Advert"

==============================
CORE EXPERIENCE GOAL
==============================

When the user scrolls:
• The page should feel like a camera moving through space
• Background elements move at different depths
• Smooth, cinematic, luxury motion
• Similar FEEL to rangerover3d.vercel.app

==============================
THREE.JS SCENE (MANDATORY)
==============================

Create ONE global Three.js scene:

- Fullscreen canvas fixed in background
- Dark navy / blue gradient environment
- Elements inside scene:
  • abstract planes
  • soft glowing particles
  • grid or lines for depth
  • subtle light sources

NO real-world objects
NO text inside Three.js

==============================
SCROLL → CAMERA MOVEMENT
==============================

On scroll:
• Move camera slowly on Z-axis (forward motion)
• Slight X/Y drift for cinematic feel
• Change depth of background layers
• Smooth interpolation (lerp)

Each section scroll = camera position change
(similar to rangerover3d scroll experience)

==============================
PARALLAX LAYERS
==============================

Content layers:
• Text layer → closest to user (moves least)
• Mid background → slow movement
• Deep background → more movement

This creates 3D depth illusion.

==============================
SECTION ANIMATION
==============================

As camera moves:
• Sections fade in naturally
• Slight upward motion (10–20px)
• No text masking
• No background blocks on text

Cards:
• Enter with depth-based animation
• Subtle shadow increase

==============================
PERFORMANCE RULES
==============================

• Use requestAnimationFrame
• Optimize for 60fps
• Respect prefers-reduced-motion
• Disable heavy effects on mobile
• Mobile fallback = normal scroll animation

==============================
STRICT RULES
==============================

❌ No animated text backgrounds
❌ No blue blocks
❌ No rotating text
❌ No flashy effects

✔ Text always readable
✔ Three.js only for background + camera motion
✔ Clean premium agency look

==============================
FINAL RESULT
==============================

A "Washington Advert" website that:
• Feels like a cinematic 3D experience
• Has rangerover3d-style scroll depth
• Remains lightweight & professional
• Is client-ready and production-safe
