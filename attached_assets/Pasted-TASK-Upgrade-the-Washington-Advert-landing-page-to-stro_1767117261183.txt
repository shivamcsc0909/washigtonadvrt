TASK:
Upgrade the "Washington Advert" landing page
to strongly reflect a WASHINGTON DC identity,
with richer content and cinematic scroll animations
inspired by rangerover3d.vercel.app.

IMPORTANT:
• Brand name must remain "Washington Advert"
• Layout already exists — enhance it, do not replace it
• Focus on Washington DC feel, depth, and storytelling

================================
WASHINGTON DC VISUAL IDENTITY
================================

Use Washington DC inspiration subtly:

• Inspired by US Capitol architecture
• Clean, powerful, authoritative, premium look
• Trust, policy, leadership, growth feeling

BACKGROUND USAGE:
• Use a blurred / darkened Washington DC inspired background
• Add strong dark-blue overlay
• Do NOT place sharp full photo behind text
• Background should feel atmospheric, not literal

================================
THREE.JS BACKGROUND (MANDATORY)
================================

Create a global Three.js background scene:

• Abstract architectural lines
• Subtle grid / columns / depth planes
• Soft glowing particles
• Light fog / vignette

Inspired by:
• Government buildings
• Monumental scale
• Stability & trust

================================
RANGEROOVER-STYLE SCROLL EXPERIENCE
================================

SCROLL SHOULD FEEL LIKE:
• Camera moving forward
• Sections passing through space
• Cinematic depth

IMPLEMENT:

1) SCROLL → CAMERA Z MOVEMENT
• Camera moves slowly forward on scroll
• Slight X/Y drift for cinematic feel
• Smooth lerp interpolation

2) PARALLAX DEPTH
• Foreground text: minimal movement
• Mid layers: slow movement
• Deep background: more movement

3) SECTION ENTRY
• Fade in + translateY (20px)
• Trigger once per section
• Smooth easing

================================
CONTENT EXPANSION (IMPORTANT)
================================

Increase landing page content to feel premium:

ADD:
• Short intro paragraph below hero
• Micro-copy under each service
• Trust / credibility mini-section
• Strategy explanation blocks
• US-focused language (growth, scale, authority)

Avoid:
• Long boring paragraphs
• Marketing fluff

================================
STRICT UI RULES
================================

❌ No text masking
❌ No blue blocks
❌ No animated text background
❌ No heavy 3D objects

✔ Text always readable
✔ Three.js only for atmosphere
✔ Smooth, professional motion

================================
MOBILE & PERFORMANCE
================================

• Reduce 3D intensity on mobile
• Fallback to simple scroll animations
• Maintain 60fps
• Respect prefers-reduced-motion

FINAL RESULT:
A Washington Advert landing page that:
• Feels like Washington DC
• Has cinematic scroll like rangerover3d
• Feels authoritative & premium
• Is content-rich & client-ready
